1. Vanilla lstm with no pre trained embedding.                                      -> OK
2. Propagate lstm hidden cell for generation.                                       -> OK
3. Better lstm model architectures.                                                 -> Will not do
4. Use personnal collection midi instead of LAHK for music generation_data_loader   -> OK
5. Learning rate scheduler                                                          -> OK
6. Change skipgram to output other chords instead of a single chord                 -> Will not do
7. Fix Accuracy for skip gram                                                       -> Will not do
8. Data augmentation with scale augmentation                                        -> Will not do
9. Experiment with vector add/substract of embeddings                               ->
10. Write medium article                                                            ->
